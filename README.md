# COMP30022-Project: Eportfolio by Potato Powered Portfolios

## Introduction
This is an Eportfolio website created by Potato Powered Portfolios, for the group CRXMM. It was created for
the subject of "IT Project" (COMP30022) at the University of Melbourne.

## Aim
Create an Eportfolio site that displays and celebrates the biographies, achievements and experiences of the
individuals of CRXMM, whilst also displaying their group project, "Beth Beauty Care".


## Usage
#This Eportfolio runs off the MERN stack.
#It is currently being hosted on heroku, which requires you to connect a git repo to 

@Richard, finish the above line


## Important information if you wish to edit the portfolio
#To run locally, open a command line, cd into the root of this project and run the command "npm run local" 
#To change what email account emails sent through the contact form will go to, adjust line 33 of contact.js 
with your email (in the routes folder). 
#we have made an api for you to add your personal projects through. Simply navigate to the login button, enter
the credentials we gave you and follow the prompt
#To edit any of the pictures on display, first identify the name of the picture you want to replace. Rename your 
new photo so it has this same name, then place the file photoUploader.js (currently in the root of the project) 
in the same folder as the new photo. Change lines 14, 15 and 18 so they say the photo name and then save and run 
the photo uploader by typing "node photoUploader". Your new photo should now display on the website :)
#any edits to the current display will require you to navigate to the react folder, then src, then pages. 
HomePage.js stores the overall structure of the user interface, and the rest of the front end components are in 
this folder as well.
