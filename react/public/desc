public

This folder is called public because it is available to the public. It's contents are
automatically set routes by the express.static function.

That means it can be accessed via browser by using the url, such as below:
https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png

Or you can also access it from html on the client side, like with the below tag
<img src="https://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maxresdefault.jpg">

The public folder is especially important for referencing resources from the client side,
(the users computer) including images, javascripts and stylesheets.
